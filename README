This is a fork of Dromaeo that tests the performance impact of the
ShadowDOM polyfill found at:

  https://github.com/toolkitchen/polyfills/tree/master/ShadowDOM

To run the tests with the polyfill enabled append #polyfill to the URL. For
example:

  http://localhost:8000/web/index.html?dom#polyfill

Some of the tests are not impacted by the polyfill yet because the polyfill is far
from complete.

This uses git submodules so you need to run:

  git submodules init
  git submodules update
